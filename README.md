# Machine learning bootcamp (2024): 
### This repository compiles all the assignments associated with SDAIA Machine Learning Projects Bootcamp.

* ## _**The first assignment:**_

We utilized the "hotel booking" dataset for exploratory data analysis and visualization. We created various visualizations to gain deeper insights and identify areas for data cleaning. This process serves as a crucial first step in our analysis, then we proceed with data cleaning.

* ## _**The second assignment:**_
* We utilized two datset then we combine them to single dataset. We used it for exploratory data analysis and visualization. We created various visualizations to gain deeper insights and identify areas for data processing and we make it ready for prediction using logistic regression.
